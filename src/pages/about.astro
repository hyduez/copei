            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              We're from  AE10's course of cycle I118, and we're presenting on fast food vs. healthy food. We're tired of the same old narrative of “eat this, not that.”
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              This project was born from a simple idea: what if we could talk 'bout nutrition without feeling guilty? What if eating healthy didn't have to be boring? So here we are, celebrating salad bowls and midnight snacks, green smoothies and ice cream. Because life is all about BALANCE, and balance is delicious. 🎉

              <p class="text-gray-700">
                To make nutrition approachable, fun, and judgment-free. We believe everyone deserves 
                to enjoy their food without feeling guilty or confused.

                Serious about health, but not serious about ourselves. We fact-check everything, 
                but we're not afraid to joke about our love for carbs.

                Help you make food choices that work for YOUR life. No one-size-fits-all diets, 
                no shame, just real talk about real food.
